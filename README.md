# Jupyter notebook templates

This repository contains templates for Jupyter notebook based ECMWF learning resources.

It is not compulsory to use these templates, but you may find them useful and they may help to ensure our learning resources are in a consistent format.

Please find here a set of [best practices in developing Jupyter notebooks](/best-practices.md)

For metadata to be applied at the notebook level and at the cell level, please [consult the metadata-schema](https://github.com/ecmwf-training/jn-metadata-schema).
